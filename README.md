# ProtoQL

Research prototype: compile GraphQL query selections into a dynamic response projection, encode with Protocol Buffers, and serve over gRPC.

**Status:** proof-of-concept — validating technical feasibility.

## Hypothesis

If clients can define GraphQL response shape, that shape can also define a transient binary serialization contract without a static `.proto` per query.

## Pipeline (target)

```text
GraphQL query → projection plan → in-memory evaluation → dynamic descriptor → protobuf bytes → gRPC
```

## Current milestone

gRPC transport: `Execute` RPC accepts a GraphQL query and returns projection wire bytes plus a `FileDescriptorSet` (`internal/transport`).

```bash
go test ./internal/transport/...
```

The query compiler lives in `internal/compile`.

```bash
go test ./internal/compile/...
```

## Development

Requires Go 1.22 or later.

```bash
go test ./...
```
